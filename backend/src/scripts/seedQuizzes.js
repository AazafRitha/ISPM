    body: `# Introduction to Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.

## Key Concepts

### Confidentiality
Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.

### Integrity
Maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of information over its entire lifecycle.

### Availability
Ensuring that information and resources are available to authorized users when needed.

## Common Threats

1. **Malware** - Malicious software designed to damage or gain unauthorized access
2. **Phishing** - Attempts to steal sensitive information through deceptive emails
3. **Ransomware** - Malware that encrypts files and demands payment for decryption
4. **Social Engineering** - Manipulating people into revealing confidential information

## Best Practices

- Keep software updated
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Be cautious with email attachments
- Regular data backups
- Employee training and awareness

Remember: Cybersecurity is everyone's responsibility!`,

    body: `# Password Security Best Practices

## Creating Strong Passwords

### Length Matters
- Use at least 12 characters
- Longer passwords are exponentially harder to crack

### Character Variety
- Mix uppercase and lowercase letters
- Include numbers and special characters
- Avoid common substitutions (e.g., @ for a)

### Avoid Common Patterns
- Don't use dictionary words
- Avoid personal information
- Don't use keyboard patterns (qwerty, 123456)

## Password Management

### Use a Password Manager
- Generate unique passwords for each account
- Store passwords securely
- Enable two-factor authentication on the password manager

### Regular Updates
- Change passwords periodically
- Update immediately if breach is suspected
- Don't reuse passwords across accounts

### Additional Security
- Enable two-factor authentication where available
- Use biometric authentication when possible
- Be cautious on public networks

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Using the same password everywhere
2. Sharing passwords via email or text
3. Writing passwords on sticky notes
4. Using easily guessable information
5. Ignoring security breach notifications

Remember: Your password is often the first line of defense against unauthorized access!`,
